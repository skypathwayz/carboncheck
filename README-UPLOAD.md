# 🚀 READY TO UPLOAD - CARBON-READY-TO-UPLOAD

## **✅ FILES ARE ORGANIZED AND READY!**

I've created a clean folder called `CARBON-READY-TO-UPLOAD` on your desktop with everything properly organized.

## **📁 WHAT'S IN THE FOLDER:**

### **Root Files (Upload these directly):**
- ✅ `index.html` (with blog link)
- ✅ `about-us.html`, `contact.html`, `faq.html`
- ✅ All article files (article-1-reduce-footprint.html, etc.)
- ✅ All AMP files (index-amp.html, about-us-amp.html, etc.)
- ✅ `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`

### **📁 Folders (Upload these as folders):**
- ✅ `blog/` folder (contains 5 HTML files)
- ✅ `assets/` folder (contains 6 image files)

## **🚀 HOW TO UPLOAD:**

### **Step 1: Go to Your GitHub Repo**
1. Open `https://github.com/skypathwayz/carboncheck` in your browser
2. Make sure you're on the `main` branch

### **Step 2: Delete the CARBON-UPLOAD Folder**
1. Click on the `CARBON-UPLOAD` folder
2. Delete it (this will clean up the old structure)

### **Step 3: Upload Everything**
1. **Drag the entire `CARBON-READY-TO-UPLOAD` folder** to your GitHub repo
2. **GitHub will ask** if you want to upload all files
3. **Click "Upload files"**
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to rebuild

### **Step 4: Test**
1. Go to `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/`
2. Click the "Blog" link in the header
3. It should work! 🎉

## **🎯 WHAT WILL HAPPEN:**

After upload, your repo structure will be:
```
carboncheck/
├── index.html
├── blog/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── driving-co2-per-mile.html
│   └── (other blog files)
├── assets/
│   └── (image files)
└── (other files)
```

**The `blog/` folder will be at the root level, not inside another folder!**

## **✅ READY TO GO!**

Just drag the `CARBON-READY-TO-UPLOAD` folder to GitHub and you're done! 🚀
