## **🚨 ISSUE:**
GitHub Pages can't find the `blog/` folder, even though it exists.

## **🔍 MOST LIKELY CAUSES:**

### **1. Blog Folder Not Uploaded to GitHub**
- The `blog/` folder might not have been uploaded properly
- **Check:** Go to your GitHub repo, do you see a `blog/` folder?

### **2. Blog Folder in Wrong Location**
- The `blog/` folder might be inside another folder
- **Check:** Is `blog/` at the same level as `index.html`?

### **3. Case Sensitivity Issue**
- GitHub Pages is case-sensitive
- **Check:** Is it `blog/` (lowercase) not `Blog/` or `BLOG/`?

### **4. GitHub Pages Cache**

- **Fix:** Wait 10 minutes or force rebuild

## **🔧 IMMEDIATE FIXES:**

### **Fix 1: Verify Blog Folder in GitHub**
1. Go to your GitHub repo in browser
2. Look for `blog/` folder in the root directory
3. Click on it - you should see the HTML files
4. If it's not there, re-upload it

### **Fix 2: Check Folder Location**
1. Make sure `blog/` is at the same level as `index.html`
2. Not inside another folder like `CARBON-UPLOAD/blog/`

### **Fix 3: Force Rebuild**
1. Make a tiny change to `index.html` (add a space)
2. Commit and push
3. Wait 5-10 minutes

### **Fix 4: Test Direct Access**
Try these URLs:
- `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/` (should work)

## **🎯 QUICK TEST:**

**Can you see the `blog/` folder in your GitHub repo?**
