# üö® 404 STILL HAPPENING - DIAGNOSTIC STEPS

## **üîç Let's Debug This Step by Step:**

### **Step 1: Check Your GitHub Repo Structure**
1. Go to your GitHub repo in a browser
2. Look for these folders/files in the root:
   - ‚úÖ `index.html` (should be there)
   - ‚úÖ `blog/` folder (click on it)
   - ‚úÖ `assets/` folder (click on it)

### **Step 2: Verify Blog Folder Contents**
Click on the `blog/` folder. You should see:
- `index.html`
- `driving-co2-per-mile.html`
- `chicken-vs-beef-footprint.html`
- `offset-carbon-cheap.html`
- `test.html`

### **Step 3: Check GitHub Pages Settings**
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
2. **Source:** Should be set to your branch (usually `main` or `master`)
3. **Branch:** Should be `/ (root)` (NOT `/docs` or any other folder)
4. **Custom domain:** Should show `carbonchecks.com`

### **Step 4: Check GitHub Actions**
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Look for any failed builds
3. If there are errors, they'll show here

### **Step 5: Test Different URLs**
Try these exact URLs:
1. `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/` (should work)
2. `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/index.html` (explicit path)
3. `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/test.html` (test file)

## **üö® COMMON ISSUES:**

### **Issue 1: Wrong Branch**
- If your files are in `main` but Pages is set to `master` (or vice versa)
- Fix: Change the branch in Settings ‚Üí Pages

### **Issue 2: Files in Wrong Location**
- If files are in a subfolder instead of root
- Fix: Move them to the root directory

### **Issue 3: Case Sensitivity**
- GitHub Pages is case-sensitive
- Make sure `blog/` is lowercase

### **Issue 4: Build Errors**
- Check Actions tab for failed builds
- Fix any errors shown there

## **‚ö° QUICK FIXES TO TRY:**

### **Fix 1: Force Rebuild**
1. Make a tiny change to `index.html` (add a space)
2. Commit and push
3. Wait 5 minutes

### **Fix 2: Check Branch**
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Change source branch if needed
3. Save and wait

### **Fix 3: Verify File Structure**
1. Make sure `blog/` folder is in the root (same level as `index.html`)
2. Not inside another folder

## **üéØ WHAT TO CHECK FIRST:**

1. **Is the `blog/` folder in your GitHub repo root?**
2. **What branch is GitHub Pages set to?**
3. **Are there any build errors in Actions?**
