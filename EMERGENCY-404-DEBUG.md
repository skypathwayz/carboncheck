# üö® STILL 404 AFTER UPLOAD - EMERGENCY TROUBLESHOOTING

## **üîç Let's Debug This Systematically:**

### **Step 1: Check Your GitHub Repo Structure**
1. Go to `https://github.com/skypathwayz/carboncheck` in your browser
2. **Look at the file structure** - what do you see in the root directory?
3. **Is there a `blog/` folder?** (click on it if it exists)
4. **Are the files at the root level** or inside another folder?

### **Step 2: Check GitHub Pages Settings**
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Pages**
2. **Source:** What branch is it set to? (usually `main` or `master`)
3. **Branch:** Should be `/ (root)`
4. **Custom domain:** Should show `carbonchecks.com`

### **Step 3: Check GitHub Actions**
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repo
2. **Look for any failed builds** (red X marks)
3. **Check the latest workflow run** - is it successful?

### **Step 4: Test Different URLs**
Try these exact URLs:
1. `https://carbonchecks.com/` (main site - should work)
2. `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/` (blog index)
3. `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/index.html` (explicit path)
4. `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/test.html` (test file)

## **üö® MOST LIKELY ISSUES:**

### **Issue 1: Files Still in Wrong Location**
- The `blog/` folder might still be inside another folder
- **Fix:** Move all files to the root directory

### **Issue 2: Wrong Branch**
- Files uploaded to wrong branch
- **Fix:** Change GitHub Pages source branch

### **Issue 3: Build Errors**
- GitHub Pages build is failing
- **Fix:** Check Actions tab for errors

### **Issue 4: Cache Issues**
- Browser or GitHub Pages cache
- **Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or wait longer

## **‚ö° QUICK FIXES TO TRY:**

### **Fix 1: Force Rebuild**
1. Make a tiny change to `index.html` (add a space)
2. Commit and push
3. Wait 5-10 minutes

### **Fix 2: Check File Structure**
1. Make sure `blog/` folder is at the same level as `index.html`
2. Not inside `CARBON-READY-TO-UPLOAD/` or any other folder

### **Fix 3: Verify Branch**
1. Check which branch your files are in
2. Make sure GitHub Pages is serving from that branch

## **üéØ WHAT TO CHECK RIGHT NOW:**

1. **What do you see in your GitHub repo root directory?**
2. **Is there a `blog/` folder there?**
3. **What branch is GitHub Pages set to?**
4. **Are there any errors in the Actions tab?**
