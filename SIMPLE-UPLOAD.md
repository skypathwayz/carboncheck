# 🚀 SIMPLE UPLOAD GUIDE - Copy Everything!

## **✅ WHAT TO DO:**

1. **Go to your GitHub repo** (where carbonchecks.com is hosted)
2. **Copy ALL files** from the `CARBON-UPLOAD` folder
3. **Paste everything** into your GitHub repo root directory
4. **Upload the 2 folders:**
   - 📁 `blog/` folder (with all 5 HTML files)
   - 📁 `assets/` folder (with all 6 image files)
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to rebuild
6. **Test:** Go to `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/`

## **📁 FOLDERS TO UPLOAD:**

### **`blog/` folder contains:**
- ✅ index.html (blog homepage)
- ✅ driving-co2-per-mile.html
- ✅ chicken-vs-beef-footprint.html
- ✅ offset-carbon-cheap.html
- ✅ test.html (you can delete this later if you want)

### **`assets/` folder contains:**
- ✅ driving-co2-per-mile.jpg + .webp
- ✅ chicken-vs-beef-footprint.jpg + .webp
- ✅ offset-carbon-cheap.jpg + .webp

## **📄 FILES TO UPLOAD (in root):**
- ✅ index.html (updated with blog link)
- ✅ sitemap.xml (updated)
- ✅ robots.txt (updated)
- ✅ All other existing files (about-us.html, contact.html, etc.)

## **⚠️ IMPORTANT:**
- Upload **everything** from `CARBON-UPLOAD` folder
- Make sure the `blog/` and `assets/` folders are **inside** your repo root
- Don't put them in a subfolder - they should be at the same level as `index.html`

## **✅ AFTER UPLOAD:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes
2. Test: `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/`
3. Test: Click "Blog" link in header
4. Done! 🎉
