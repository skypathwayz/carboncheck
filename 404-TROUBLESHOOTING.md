# 🔍 GITHUB PAGES 404 TROUBLESHOOTING

## **✅ Files Uploaded Successfully**
Since drag & drop worked, your files are now in GitHub. The 404 means GitHub Pages isn't serving them yet.

## **🚨 COMMON CAUSES & FIXES:**

### **1. GitHub Pages Needs Time to Rebuild**
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** after upload
- GitHub Pages can take up to 10 minutes to deploy
- Check: Your repo → Actions tab → Look for "pages build and deployment"

### **2. Wrong Branch/Directory**
- Go to: **Settings** → **Pages**
- **Source:** Should be set to your branch (usually `main` or `master`)
- **Branch:** Should be `/ (root)`
- If it's set to `/docs` or another folder, change it to `/ (root)`

### **3. Check File Structure in GitHub**
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Look for the `blog/` folder
3. Click on it - you should see:
   - `index.html`
   - `driving-co2-per-mile.html`
   - `chicken-vs-beef-footprint.html`
   - `offset-carbon-cheap.html`
   - `test.html`

### **4. Force a Rebuild**
1. Make a tiny change to any file (add a space)
2. Commit the change
3. Wait 3-5 minutes
4. Try again

### **5. Check GitHub Actions**
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repo
2. Look for any failed builds
3. If there are errors, they'll show here

## **🧪 TEST THESE URLs:**

Try these in order:
1. `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/` (should work)
2. `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/index.html` (explicit path)
3. `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/test.html` (test file)

## **⚡ QUICK FIX:**

1. **Wait 5 more minutes**
2. **Try hard refresh** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **Check GitHub Actions** for build status
4. **Verify Settings** → Pages → Source is set to `/ (root)`

## **🎯 Most Likely Cause:**
GitHub Pages is still building. It can take 5-10 minutes after upload.

**Wait a bit longer and try again!** 🚀
