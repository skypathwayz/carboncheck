# 🚨 BOTH LINKS 404 - GITHUB PAGES CONFIG ISSUE

## **🔍 DIAGNOSIS:**
Both `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/` and `https://carbonchecks.com/blog/index.html` giving 404 means GitHub Pages isn't serving the blog folder at all.

## **🚨 MOST LIKELY CAUSES:**

### **1. Wrong Branch (Most Common)**
- Your files are in one branch, but GitHub Pages is serving from another
- **Check:** Settings → Pages → Source branch

### **2. Files Not in Root Directory**
- The `blog/` folder might be inside another folder
- **Check:** Is `blog/` at the same level as `index.html`?

### **3. GitHub Pages Not Enabled**
- Pages might not be enabled for your repo
- **Check:** Settings → Pages → Should show "Your site is published at..."

### **4. Build Errors**
- GitHub Pages build might be failing
- **Check:** Actions tab for any red X marks

## **🔧 IMMEDIATE FIXES TO TRY:**

### **Fix 1: Check Branch Settings**
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click **Settings** → **Pages**
3. **Source:** Should be set to your branch (usually `main` or `master`)
4. **Branch:** Should be `/ (root)`
5. If it's wrong, change it and save

### **Fix 2: Verify File Structure**
1. Go to your GitHub repo main page
2. You should see `blog/` folder at the same level as `index.html`
3. If `blog/` is inside another folder, move it to root

### **Fix 3: Force Rebuild**
1. Make a tiny change to any file (add a space)
2. Commit and push
3. Wait 5-10 minutes

### **Fix 4: Check Actions**
1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Look for any failed builds (red X marks)
3. If there are errors, fix them

## **🎯 QUICK TEST:**

Try accessing your main site first:
- `https://carbonchecks.com/` (should work)
- If this also gives 404, then GitHub Pages isn't working at all

## **⚡ EMERGENCY FIX:**

If nothing works, try this:
1. **Delete the `blog/` folder** from GitHub
2. **Re-upload it** using the "Add file" → "Upload files" method
3. **Wait 5 minutes**
4. **Test again**

## **🔍 WHAT TO CHECK RIGHT NOW:**

1. **Is your main site working?** (`https://carbonchecks.com/`)
2. **What branch is GitHub Pages set to?** (Settings → Pages)
3. **Can you see the `blog/` folder in your repo root?**
