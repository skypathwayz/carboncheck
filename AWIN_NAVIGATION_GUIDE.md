# Awin Dashboard Navigation Guide - Finding Merchants

## üîç WHERE TO FIND MERCHANTS IN AWIN

Based on your dashboard, here's where to look:

### Option 1: Main Navigation Menu
Look at the top navigation bar. You should see tabs like:
- **"Dashboard"** (you're here now)
- **"Advertisers"** ‚Üê Click this!
- **"Programs"** ‚Üê Or this!
- **"Reports"**
- **"Tools"**
- **"Support"**

**Click "Advertisers" or "Programs"** to see available merchants.

---

### Option 2: If You Don't See Those Tabs

**Try this:**
1. Look for a **menu icon** (‚ò∞) in the top-left
2. Or check the **left sidebar** (if visible)
3. Or look for **"Advertiser Marketplace"** or **"Browse Advertisers"**

---

### Option 3: Direct URL
Try navigating to:
- `ui.awin.com/advertisers` 
- `ui.awin.com/programs`
- `ui.awin.com/advertiser-marketplace`

---

### Option 4: Use Search
1. Look for a **search bar** at the top of the dashboard
2. Type: "solar", "energy", "home improvement", "sustainable"
3. This should show relevant merchants

---

### Option 5: Activity Stream
Since you just got approved, check:
- **"Activity Stream"** section (you can see this)
- Sometimes Awin suggests merchants there
- Or shows "recommended programs"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POSSIBLE REASONS YOU DON'T SEE MERCHANTS:

### 1. **Account Still Setting Up**
- New accounts sometimes take a few hours to fully activate
- Wait 2-4 hours and check again

### 2. **Need to Complete Profile**
- Check if there's a profile completion status
- Look for notifications or alerts at the top

### 3. **Different Navigation**
- Awin may have updated their interface
- Try clicking around different sections

## üéØ WHAT TO DO NOW:

1. **Check the top navigation tabs** - Look for "Advertisers" or "Programs"
2. **Check left sidebar** - If there is one, look for merchant-related links
3. **Try the search bar** - Search for "solar" or "energy"
4. **Wait a few hours** - If account just activated, merchant list might populate later
5. **Contact Awin Support** - Use the "Need help? Ask Ava" button in bottom-right

---

## üìã ALTERNATIVE: APPLY DIRECTLY TO SOLAR PROGRAMS

While waiting for Awin merchant list:

**Apply to these directly:**
1. **Inergy Solar** - https://inergy.grin.live/
2. **SunPower** - https://us.sunpower.com/affiliate-programs  
3. **A1 Solar Store** - https://www.a1solarstore.com/affiliate-program

These might be faster than waiting for Awin's merchant list.

## üí° TIP

**Screenshot your dashboard** and I can help identify where the merchant/program section might be hidden. Or describe what you see in the top navigation bar.

**Common places:**
- Top tabs: Advertisers, Programs, Marketplace
- Left menu: Advertisers, Browse Programs
- Search box: At the top of the page

Let me know what navigation options you see!
