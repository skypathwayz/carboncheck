# Sovrn Simple Guide - What You Actually Need

## ‚úÖ YOU HAVE ALREADY:
**Amazon Sovrn Link:** `https://sovrn.co/tb8n0h3`

## üéØ WHAT TO DO NOW:

### Step 1: Test Your Link (Get First Click)
1. Visit your live site: `carbonchecks.com`
2. Click your Amazon link OR
3. Directly visit: `https://sovrn.co/tb8n0h3`
4. This triggers the "first click" Sovrn needs

### Step 2: Wait for Approval
- Sovrn will review your site after they see the click
- Usually takes 1-3 business days

### Step 3: Use Your Link (After Approval)
**For Amazon links on your site**, you have two options:

**Option A: Keep using Skimlinks** (current setup)
- Already working
- No changes needed

**Option B: Switch to Sovrn** (if you prefer)
- Replace Amazon URLs with: `https://sovrn.co/tb8n0h3?url=ORIGINAL_AMAZON_URL`
- Example: `https://sovrn.co/tb8n0h3?url=https://www.amazon.com/s?k=solar+panel+kits`

## ‚ùì DO YOU NEED OTHER MERCHANTS?

**Short answer:** No, not required. You can:
- Just use Sovrn for Amazon (if you want)
- Keep Skimlinks for everything (if it's working)
- Or add other merchants later when needed

**The other merchant list** (`SOVRN_OTHER_MERCHANTS.md`) is optional - only if you want to track those specific stores separately.

## ‚úÖ BOTTOM LINE:
- You have your Amazon Sovrn link: `https://sovrn.co/tb8n0h3`
- Click it once to trigger Sovrn approval
- Everything else is optional
