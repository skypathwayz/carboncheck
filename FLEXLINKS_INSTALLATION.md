## 🎯 WHAT FLEXLINKS DOES

**Automatic Link Conversion:**
- Converts **non-affiliate merchant links** → **FlexOffers affiliate links**
- Works automatically for **all approved merchants** in FlexOffers
- No manual link editing needed!

**How It Works:**
1. You have a regular link: `https://example-merchant.com/product`
2. If that merchant is in FlexOffers and you're approved
3. Flexlinks automatically adds your tracking: `https://example-merchant.com/product?ref=YOUR_ID`
4. You earn commission automatically!

## 📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW

### **Requirements:**
- ✅ Must be **approved** to merchant program first
- ✅ Merchant must be in FlexOffers network
- ✅ Link must be to merchant's main domain

### **How It Works:**
- Scans your page for merchant links

## 🔍 TESTING FLEXLINKS

### **How to Verify It's Working:**

2. **Link to an approved merchant** (e.g., if Best Eco Shop approved you)
