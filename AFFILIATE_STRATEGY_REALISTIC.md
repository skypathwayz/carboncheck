# Realistic Affiliate Strategy - The Truth About Your Options

## ‚ö†Ô∏è THE REALITY

**There isn't another network exactly like Skimlinks** that:
- ‚úÖ Automatically converts links
- ‚úÖ Has solar/energy merchants
- ‚úÖ No individual merchant approvals
- ‚úÖ Easy setup

**Why:** Most automatic networks (like Skimlinks) focus on general retail, not niche solar/energy products.

## ‚úÖ YOUR BEST OPTIONS (Ranked)

### Option 1: **Amazon Associates** ‚≠ê YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS!
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Active (`skypathwayz-21`)
- **What it covers:** ALL Amazon products including:
  - Solar panel kits
  - Energy monitors
  - Smart thermostats
  - LED bulbs
  - EV chargers
  - Thousands more
- **Setup:** ‚úÖ Already done (auto-tagging working)
- **No approval needed:** Already approved!
- **Commission:** Standard Amazon rates (4-10%)

**This is working NOW!** Your Amazon links are already earning.

---

### Option 3: **VigLink** (Separate from Sovrn)

**Try this if:** You want automatic conversion for general retail links

---

### Option 4: **FlexOffers** (You're Already Applied)
- **Status:** Pending review (1-2 business days)
- **What:** Network with many merchants
- **Merchants:** Search once approved (may have energy brands)
- **Setup:** Individual merchant applications needed

---
